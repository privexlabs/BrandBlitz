# Anti-Cheat Policy

This document outlines the rules and enforcement tiers for BrandBlitz anti-cheat systems.

## 1. Detection Signals

| Signal | Logic | Action | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bot Reaction** | `reactionTimeMs < 80` | Hard Block (403) | Critical |
| **Suspicious Reaction** | `80 <= reactionTimeMs < 150` | Record Flag | Warning |
| **Excessive Lag** | `reactionTimeMs > 30000` | Record Flag | Info |
| **Multi-Account Device** | `accounts_per_device >= 3` (per 24h) | Record Flag | Warning |

## 2. Enforcement Tiers

### Critical (Block)
Any activity meeting "Critical" thresholds is rejected immediately. The server returns a `403 Forbidden` error. The round data is discarded and not persisted to the database.

### Warning (Soft Flag)
Activities meeting "Warning" thresholds are allowed to complete. However:
- A `fraud_flag` is linked to the session.
- The session is marked as "Ineligible" for pool payouts.
- The user may be hidden from public competitive leaderboards.

## 3. Payout Eligibility
BrandBlitz strictly pays out only for "Clean" sessions. A session is eligible for a portion of the challenge pool ONLY IF it has zero associated fraud flags. 

The worker process checks for the existence of any entries in the `fraud_flags` table for a given `session_id` before processing payouts.
