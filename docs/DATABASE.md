# Database Reference

This document explains the canonical BrandBlitz schema, the current table relationships, and the ownership rules used by contributors and auditors.

![Database ER Diagram](./db/er.svg)

## Overview

- `init.sql` is the canonical source for a fresh PostgreSQL schema.
- `migrations/` contains incremental deltas for existing databases.
- `docs/db/er.svg` is auto-generated from the live schema.
- `pnpm docs:db` regenerates the ER diagram from `DATABASE_URL` or the default local dev database.
- CI validates that `docs/db/er.svg` is fresh for each change to `init.sql`, migrations, or docs.

## Conventions

- Every table includes `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()` and `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()`.
- A shared trigger function updates `updated_at` on every row change.
- `init.sql` should remain the single source of truth for fresh install schema.
- `migrations/` should only contain schema deltas for existing deployments.

## Domain ownership

| Table | Ownership |
|---|---|
| `users` | identity / auth |
| `brands` | brand management |
| `challenges` | challenge lifecycle |
| `challenge_questions` | challenge content |
| `game_sessions` | gameplay state |
| `session_round_scores` | gameplay scoring |
| `payouts` | settlement / finance |
| `fraud_flags` | anti-cheat / risk |
| `league_assignments` | ranking / leaderboard |
| `user_badges` | achievements |
| `referrals` | growth / referral |

## Soft delete and retention

- `brands.deleted_at` is currently the only soft-delete marker in the schema.
- No other table implements application-level soft deletes today.
- There is no schema-level automatic retention policy in this repo; row retention is currently indefinite unless additional cleanup logic is added.

## Regenerating the ER diagram

Run from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm docs:db
```

If `DATABASE_URL` is unset, the script defaults to the local development DB at:

```bash
postgresql://brandblitz:brandblitz_dev@127.0.0.1:5432/brandblitz?sslmode=disable
```

CI asserts that the generated diagram matches `docs/db/er.svg`.
