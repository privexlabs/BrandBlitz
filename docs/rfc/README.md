# Requests for Comments (RFCs)

This directory contains Request for Comments documents that propose architectural decisions, patterns, and refactoring strategies for BrandBlitz.

## Active RFCs

### Architecture & Patterns

- **[RFC 1263: Formalize test naming/boundary convention](./1263-test-naming-convention.md)** — Proposes standardized naming (`*.unit.test.ts`, `*.integration.test.ts`) and allowed dependencies for each tier across `apps/api/src`, with guidelines for CI and local development.

- **[RFC 1266: Standardized web API client](./1266-standardized-web-api-client.md)** — Proposes extracting a single typed API client module (`apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts`) from scattered fetch calls across routes and components, aligned with `docs/openapi.yml`.

### Domain Refactoring

- **[RFC 1264: Pure scoring engine extraction](./1264-scoring-engine-extraction.md)** — Proposes extracting scoring business logic into a pure, framework-independent module with explicit inputs/outputs, enabling reuse by batch re-scoring tools and offline dispute resolution.

- **[RFC 1267: Referral processor separation](./1267-referral-processor-separation.md)** — Proposes moving referral-bonus eligibility and payout rules from `apps/api/src/queues/processors/referral-bonus.processor.ts` into `services/referrals.ts`, leaving the processor as a thin BullMQ adapter.

- **[RFC 1249: Standalone payout worker](./1249-standalone-payout-worker.md)** — Proposes moving Stellar payout execution out of the API process into a dedicated `apps/payout-worker` service, following the existing `apps/deposit-monitor` precedent of a webhook callback instead of a second direct Postgres connection pool.

### Infrastructure

- **[RFC 1255: Unified revalidation webhook](./1255-unified-revalidation-webhook.md)** — Proposes consolidating the two Next.js on-demand revalidation route handlers (which currently read two *different* secret env var names) into one signed endpoint accepting arbitrary tags/paths.

- **[RFC 1250: Lightweight query builder](./1250-lightweight-query-builder.md)** — Proposes incremental adoption of Kysely for `apps/api/src/db/queries`, scoped away from escrow/payout SQL, distinguishing this from ADR 003's rejection of ORM auto-migrations (a different concern).

- **[RFC 1256: Shared config package](./1256-shared-config-package.md)** — Proposes extending `packages/config` with a shared Zod schema fragment for the env vars `apps/api` and `apps/deposit-monitor` genuinely have in common, without forcing app-specific vars into a shared schema.

## RFC Process

### When to Write an RFC

Write an RFC when proposing:
- A new architectural pattern or convention
- A significant refactoring spanning multiple files or modules
- A change to project-wide practices (testing, API design, etc.)

Do **not** write an RFC for:
- Single bug fixes
- Small feature additions
- Localized refactoring (one file, one domain)

### RFC Structure

Each RFC should include:

1. **Problem Statement** — What's wrong today, why it matters
2. **Current State** — Inventory of existing patterns, code locations
3. **Proposed Solution** — How to fix it, with examples
4. **Benefits** — Why this matters (maintainability, testability, reusability, etc.)
5. **Implementation Plan** — Steps to adopt, migration path for existing code
6. **Open Questions** — For discussion before approval

### Before Merging an RFC

1. **Create the issue** if not already created
2. **Write the RFC document** in `docs/rfc/` with the issue number
3. **Link from this README** (add to list above)
4. **Request review** in the PR description, mentioning maintainers
5. **Incorporate feedback** from reviewers and update the RFC
6. **Merge when approved** — at least one maintainer approval

### Implementing an RFC

Once an RFC is merged:
1. Create a separate PR for implementation
2. Reference the RFC in commit messages and PR description
3. Update the RFC's status to "Implemented" with links to PRs
4. Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` or related docs to reflect new patterns
