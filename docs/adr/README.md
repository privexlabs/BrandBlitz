# Architecture Decision Records

Load-bearing engineering decisions live here in Michael Nygard format.
See [ADR 000](./000-adr-process.md) for the format, lifecycle, and
template.

## When to write one

- The decision affects more than one module or team.
- It is hard to reverse (migrations, public API, on-chain shape).
- A reasonable reviewer would ask "why didn't we do X instead?".
- The reason isn't obvious from the code (compliance, third-party
  constraint, prior incident).

Routine choices (naming a function, picking a library version) do
not need an ADR.
