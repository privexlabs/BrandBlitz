# ADR 003: Hand-Rolled SQL Migrations over an ORM Migration Tool (#68)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The API runs against Postgres. The team evaluated three ways to
evolve the schema:

1. Drizzle / Kysely auto-migrations (generated from TypeScript models).
2. Prisma's `prisma migrate dev` workflow.
3. A hand-rolled migration runner that executes versioned SQL files.

We landed on a hand-rolled runner. This ADR captures why so a future
contributor doesn't ask "why isn't this Prisma?" and silently
re-litigate the decision.

## Decision

`apps/api/scripts/migrate.ts` runs versioned SQL files from
`migrations/` against the configured database.

- Each migration is a numbered `.sql` file (`NNNN_<slug>.sql`).
- Up-direction only by default — Postgres-shaped, write-only.
  Down-migrations are added on a case-by-case basis when the
  reverting transformation is genuinely safe and short.
- The runner uses an advisory lock so two pods racing to migrate the
  same database produce one applied sequence, not corruption.
- A `migrations_history` table records every applied id + hash; the
  runner refuses to re-run a migration whose hash changed (catches
  hand-edits of already-applied files).

## Rationale

- **Auditable**: every schema change is a plain SQL file in git that
  reviewers can read end-to-end. ORM-generated migrations often
  obscure intent behind generated text.
- **Postgres-shaped**: we lean on Postgres features (partial
  indexes, RLS, expression indexes, `CHECK` constraints,
  `generated columns`) that ORM migration generators frequently
  emit as opaque escape hatches anyway.
- **No drift channel**: the schema lives in SQL files, not in a
  TypeScript model that has to be kept in lock-step. The runtime
  query layer ([sql-template-strings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-template-strings)
  + a thin type generator) reads from the live schema.
- **Operational simplicity**: zero new third-party tools in the
  production runbook. `pnpm migrate` is just a thin wrapper around
  `psql`.

Considered alternatives:

- **Prisma migrate**: tempting because of the model-first DX, but
  adoption would force us to express our existing schema in
  `schema.prisma` then *generate* migrations from it. Net loss in
  reviewability for non-trivial migrations.
- **Drizzle migrate**: similar trade-off; the generator is
  cleaner than Prisma's, but we still pay the model-first cost.
- **Knex migrations**: viable but pulls a runtime dep we don't
  otherwise need.

## Consequences

- Every schema change requires writing SQL. No magic table /
  column auto-creation. The team treats this as a feature, not a
  burden.
- `migrate.ts` is now load-bearing — bugs in the runner can corrupt
  prod. Tested via `pnpm migrate:dryrun` in CI on every PR that
  touches `migrations/`.
- Down migrations remain rare; when they exist they're explicit and
  reviewed alongside their up counterpart.
- New contributors learn one tool (`pnpm migrate`) instead of two
  (an ORM model API + an ORM CLI).
